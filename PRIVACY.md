# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our web application, Flight Forge. By using the app, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. Data We Collect

When you use Flight Forge, we process character data locally within your browser. This means that all character data you create is stored only on your device and is never sent to our servers.

If you choose to permit it, we collect anonymous usage data to understand how Flight Forge is being used and to improve the app. This data may include:

* Features used and interactions with the app
* General usage patterns (e.g., session length, frequency of app use)

## 2. Anonymous Usage Data Collection

Upon your first visit to Flight Forge, you will be asked if you wish to share anonymous usage data. If you choose to participate, the data is collected anonymously and is not linked to your identity or any personal information. This data helps the developer analyze how the app is used but is never sold, and it is shared only in aggregated, non-identifiable sets.

If you choose not to share usage data, we will respect your decision. Your choice will be stored in a cookie for 30 days to remember your preference. You can change this preference at any time via the app’s settings.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

All character data is processed locally in your browser. It is stored on your device and is only accessible by you unless you choose to export it as a JSON file. We do not store or access your character data on our servers.

Anonymous usage data is stored for the purpose of analysis and improvement of Flight Forge. The data is retained in aggregate form and never includes personally identifiable information (PII).

## 4. Sharing of Data

We do not sell or share any personal data. However, aggregated and anonymous usage data may be shared with third parties for analysis and to improve the app. This data will always be in a non-identifiable form and cannot be traced back to any individual user.

## 5. Cookies

Flight Forge uses cookies to remember your preference on whether or not to share anonymous usage data.

You can choose to disable cookies through your browser settings.

## 6. Your Rights

Opt-In: Sharing anonymous usage data is only enabled if you choose to do so, and this preference can be changed at any time. Simply update your preference in the app’s settings.

Access to Data: Since all character data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can delete or export the data at any time.

Data Deletion: You can delete any saved character data directly from your device by removing the JSON files.

## 7. Security

We are committed to protecting the data you create within Flight Forge. Since all data is stored locally and never transmitted unless you manually export or load files, the risk of data breaches is minimized. However, we cannot guarantee 100% security for data stored on your device.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any significant changes are made, you will be notified through the app. We encourage you to periodically review this policy for any updates.
